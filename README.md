# MultiTouchGoLangDesign
Draw processes and channels, with interaction similar to [Train-of-Thought](https://github.com/steltenpower/Train-Of-Thought) , then generate GoLang code (which can indirectly be run in a webbrowser through WASM for a no-install implementation)

interaction = touch1, say "processNameA [sends]", touch2, say "variableName", untouch1, say "[to] processNameB", untouch2

Also look into [drawFBP](https://github.com/jpaulm/drawfbp)

The world is parallel, let's model it like that (from the get-go)
